### Scripts



**find_dro.ipynb**: finds optimized numerical solutions for dro orbits to provide initial conditions 

**dro.ipynb**: generates numerical solutions for dro orbits with given initial conditions, makes plots and animations for DRO analyses

---


### Dependencies
- environment *dro* is defined in /env/env_dro.yml, includes only standard packages
- needs ffmpeg for making movies https://www.ffmpeg.org
- file de442.bsp (114 MB) is automatically downloaded when running dro.ipynb for the first time from https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/ to folder *kernels/*
- spiceypy is used for generating the positions of the planets
